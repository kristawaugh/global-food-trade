# Final project proposal

**Food Transportation Impact** Proposal
*Andrew Lind & Krista Waugh*

Description:
  In our final project, we will be looking at how the importing/exporting of food across the globe has an effect on global atmospheric CO2 levels. Our initial hypothesis is that we will see a strong correlation in the increase in CO2 levels alongside the increase of food imports over the past couple decades.

Data:
  The data that will be required for this project are 1) annual food import reports from the USDA website (https://apps.fas.usda.gov/gats) and 2) the atmospheric CO2 levels data from Module 1 of the course (ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.txt). I am sure as we continue to develop our synthesis for this project, we will find the need to reference more data sets in efforts to futher back up our findings, however, these are the two necessary data sets we need to get started.

Questions/ Analysis tasks:
  1. Does the trend of global food transportation seem to have a noticeable impact on CO2 level variation? If so, how does the data support this conclusion?
  2. Reading in our "annual_food_imports.xlsx" file and filtering by just the information we need (ie: date, location, type of import, type of export).
  3. Possibly reading in some spacial data that shows the locations of food import/exports, whether or not the hotspots are mostly located in the northern or southern hemisphere, and finding the location's effect on global CO2 levels.







## Preliminary Rubric (additional areas will be added)

### Project questions must illustrate all of the following tasks:

- Some form of data access / reading into R
- Data tidying preparation
- Initial data visualization
- Use of GitHub
- Reproducible execution with use of Travis
- RMarkdown writeup, with final submission as a nicely formatted PDF document that includes code and results.
- Overall clean and clear presentation of repository, code, and explanations.

### and at least three of the following skills (this list may be modified/extended):

- Use of at least 5 `dplyr` verbs / functions
- Writing / working with custom R functions
- Creating an R package for functions used in the analysis
- Interaction with an API
- Use of regular expressions
- Use of an external relational database
- Preparing processed data for archiving / publication
- Parsing extensible data formats (JSON, XML)
- Use of spatial vector data (`sf` package) and visualization of spatial data
- Creation of an R package
