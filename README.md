# Analysis of Global Food Trade and its Contribution to Climate Change 

## Abstract
 In this report we will draw connnections between the ever increasing global food trade and the impact this trend has on climate change. We will use the "Berkeley Food Pyramid" as a framework for analyzing US import trends for a select few goods, based on the diet depicted in this image. Foods like coffee, cheese, chocolate, wine, garlic, artisan bread, and organic produce do make up a fair share of California diets, so we tracked and plotted the import trends of these foods from 1999-2017 to gain a sense of magnitude of the shipping involved in just these goods. Some of which, produce, cheese, wine and garlic are produced in large quantities in California, yet are still imported in billions of tons each year from other countries. 
  To support our analysis, we also plotted transportation emissions data to show that transportation continues to take up a larger and larger share of total emissions every year. 
  Finally, we plotted total atmospheric CO2 levels to show the overall trend towards global warming. In this report we are not suggesting that global food trade is the only cause of climate change, but we are showing that food transportation does contribute heavily to overall CO2 emissions, especially since we have only measured data from a select few foods and only analyzed emissions data from US transportation data.
